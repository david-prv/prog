## Projects
### OCaml - Mini OCaml Interpreter
Interpreter, Parser and Lexer for OCaml Sublanguage "Mini OCaml"  
[check it out](https://github.com/david-prv/mini-ocaml)

### MIPS - 2048
A 2048 implementation, written in MIPS Assembly.
We only had to develop subroutines.  
[check it out](https://github.com/david-prv/prog/tree/main/prog2/2048)

### C - Seamcarving
A Seamcarving Algorithm Implementation, written in C.
Again, we only had to implement some functionalities, not the whole thing.  
[check it out](https://github.com/david-prv/prog/tree/main/prog2/steamcarving)

### Java - URI Parser
Simple parser for a simplified URI grammer in Java.
This time, we had to implement Unit Tests AND the Parser itself (almost without any given snippets).  
[check it out](#)

### Java - Tetris
*work in progress*
